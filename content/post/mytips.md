My Tips is a tip tracking and organizing application built in Flutter and availble on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

Users can define the sources for their tips such as cash, credit, a friend, Venmo, or more. The dashboard provides a quick view of the user's tip earnings by day, week, month, and year. It also offers reports and charts to visually break down tips by source or earnings over time.
